The governors of the southeast had banned not only open grazing, but we have also banned the movement of cows by foot into the southeast, he said. In each of the five states of the southeast, we are managing ourselves very well. We have also stopped the movement of cows across communities. What we discussed in the southeast with the herdsmen, with the farmers is the method that has been in place for a long time before now.

What were they doing? They were just sitting down and gisting on their pickup.Can you imagine? In what other country will people run red lights right in front of police and the police will just be laughing with Ak47s in their hands? and it wasnt just one car, but multiple cars totally disregarding their RED lights.Are we so primitive that we are now totally averse to Law and Order in this land? That the police wont even make an attempt to maintain traffic rules unless at their own convenience? Unless traffic is at a standstill via checkpoints? is that they only time police would do traffic work?Imagine how dangerous it is to be driving with confidence because the light in front of you has turned GREEN, not knowing that a MANIAC is about to smash in",
