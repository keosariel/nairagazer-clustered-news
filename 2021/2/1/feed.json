Icha Joseph, the state commandant of the agency, stated this during a news conference in Maiduguri on Saturday, January 30, 2021. Joseph said during the lockdown in 2020, the courts were not open at all and as a result, many cases are still pending at the Federal High Court Maiduguri. A total of 16, 904.313kg of illicit drugs were seized last year, the largest seizure ever recorded in a northern state. According to Mr. Joseph, the quantum of drugs mopped up in the state indicates that there was a nexus between hard drugs and insurgency.
