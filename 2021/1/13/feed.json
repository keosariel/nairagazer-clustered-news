            "description": "I saw this post earlier today on FP. https://www.nairaland.com/6359915/police-detain-solomon-emmanuel-akumaAs expected NLders began to bash the president and DSS. Truth is that story followed from a post by Sowore on twitter. What the writer failed to mention is the real offence of Emmanuel Akuma. What did he say in criticising Buhari. Attached here is the twitter post that got him in trouble. You think because you have freedom of speech then you can say anything? Or because you are behind a keypad, you think you cannot be traced. This is a warning to youths especially, be careful of what you post online. No serious country will take that post as a joke. Emmanuel Akuma is learning an important lesson in life the hard way. Many more are already languishing in various prisons. Mind what you say online.",

The Governor said the refunded money would be deployed in providing more critical projects across the state to enhance the socio-economic life of Rivers people. He said despite being in his second term, he would continue to work relentlessly for the interest of the state and improve its stakes. He said: Rivers people, the Federal Government has refunded us the money. I have not touched a dime yet and it is in the bank. I will use it for project execution.

Wike insisted he had conducted the affairs of governance without discrimination, saying his administration an inclusive policy in project distribution. The governor said on Wednesday, January 13, 2021, that he laid a good foundation of leadership by completing all the projects he inherited from his predecessor and would complete all the projects that he initiated so that his successor would have a smooth sail in governance. He said: No matter the tactics they deplore, no party can take Rivers State away from PDP. They have to convince the people why they need the support of Rivers people. It is already known, they have nothing to offer. We have something to offer and we have offered it to the people. They are angry that we are commissioning projects.

            "description": "The Nigeria Union of Teachers, NUT, Edo State chapter, has directed all primary school teachers and school heads in the South-south states to embark on an indefinite strike from January 18 this year. The unions directive on Wednesday, January 13, 2021, was contained in a communique issued at the end of its enlarged State Wing Executive Council, SWEC, meeting in Benin. The communique was signed by Edo Chairman of NUT, Pius Okhueleigbe, the assistant secretary-general, Mike Itua, and three others. Edo NUT stated that its decision to embark on an indefinite strike was as a result of the failure of the Edo state government to meet its 10-point demands. It noted that the strike ordered was a sequel to the expiration of the 21-day and 14-day ultimatums earlier given to Godwin Obasekis administration. The communique read in part: All public primary school-heads and teachers in the 18 local government areas of Edo State should unfailingly embark on an indefinite strike from 12:00 a.m. (early m",

Kola Ologbondiyan, the PDPs national publicity secretary, spoke while appearing on Arise Television. Ologbondiyan said the ongoing discussion on the zoning of the 2023 presidential ticket in the All Progressives Congress, APC, is an indication of President Muhammadu Buharis failure. He insisted that some APC chieftains who worked towards Buharis emergence are afraid that the partys agreement wont be reached. According to Ologbondiyan: There are conversations in the APC over where to choose their next candidate from, I am aware. But we must also not lose understanding of this conversation. It is because those who worked to bring President Buhari to power and having seen the failures that are attached to the governance of President Muhammadu Buhari and all the failed promises that were made and cannot be actua",
