(MMA, Lagos)I was at the airport recently and for the fact that I had not set foot since COVID19 started, I headed to the normal \"Departure\" U-Turn first to ask for proper directions.I politely asked an FRSC official for the way to \"Arrivals\". I even explained in details that I wanted to pick someone and he directed me to where used to be \"New Arrival Park\" before.On getting there I noticed it was a bit dark but cars were parked. As normal Naija now, I felt \"NEPA\" just did their thing as usual.I drove past a gate that was opened and some Mechanic-looking guys were on the side fixing a damaged car.\"NONE OF THEM WAVED OR STOPPED ME\".Then I met another official ahead who politely told me the \"New Arrival\" was no longer functional and I should turn back.I simply obliged.On my way back, I noticed the gate I had jst passed was now close",

But from what I have seen so far, I have come to discover that job adverts specifically give preference to first class and 2.1 graduates and very few give room for 2.2 applicants. And I am yet to see any job specification that includes graduates of third class degree. Now someone with a third class degree can only do masters after completion of  a postgraduate diploma. However, job advertisements for lecturing positions still lay emphasis on minimum of 2.2 for lecturing positions. So a third class degree applicant who has masters and PhD still doesnt stand a chance as compared to first and 2.1 or 2.2 applicants.  So my question is, what is the way forward for third class graduates, should they abandon the degree and enrol for another first degree? Or  universities should abolish the award of third class degrees to graduates. In my own opinion, students who have poor grades that will eventually earn them a third class degree should be given some f",

Shehu Usman Muhammad, the state commissioner of education, told The Nation on Tuesday, January 12, 2021, that, safety of students and teachers is very important to the state government. According to him, as I told you earlier, the State Government will review the state of Covid-19 cases before fixing a date for resumption. We are still assessing the COVID-19 pandemic with keen interest and will issue a statement when the government deems fit and safe for students to resume. So, we are yet to fix date for resumption of schools. If we observe that, the figures of the Covid-19 cases are coming down, certainly we will be eager to open schools, but if the figures continue to rise, certainly we will not be in haste to open schools, he said.
