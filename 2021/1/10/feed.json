Demons are not scared of the Bible as a book and their human agents even read it and can quote the verses very well. What scares the devil is your knowledge of the authority of Jesus Christ and how you can use it as revealed in the Bible.Our God is the King of all kings, when you come before him in prayers, dont come before him nagging, come in a similar way you would approach an earthly king for a request. How to pray with the Scriptures Praying with the Bible involves praying with faith on the revelation of the scriptures. You can follow these steps:1. Have faith that all scriptures are inspired by God. (2 Tim 3:16).2. Believe without doubt that heaven and earth will pass but the Word of God will never pass away (Matt 24:35).3. Praise and thank him. (Phil 4:6-7)4 Pray for his Kingdom to come and for his will to be done. (Matt 6:",

Cost: The average cost of an anterior teeth root canal is 22k + 35k for crowning and 28k + 35k  for posterior teeth in a GOVERNMENT HOSPITAL, Private clinics  should be x2 or x3 of the quoted price. For those that dont know the meaning of crowning its a procedure to reenforce the tooth structure after a root canal procedure.

No Government Health Insurance for citizens, The so called NHIS is in shambles, the last time I checked some HMOs in NHIS dont cover RCT. Payment for Dental care is out of pocket.

            "description": "Nyesom Wike, the governor of Rivers State, has threatened to shut down the Bonny-Bille-Nembe Jetty in Port Harcourt if there are reported cases of criminality or physical violence in the area. The governor said the zeal to provide an enabling environment for sea travellers and boost the marine economy of the state, spurred his administration to remodel the once dilapidated jetty first built in the 1950s. He stated this at the commissioning of the remodelled Bonny-Bille-Nembe Jetty by the Governor of Sokoto State, Rt Hon Aminu Waziri Tambuwal on Saturday, January 9, 2021. Governor Wike, said he decided to remodel the once filthy and disused jetty because he firmly believes that the people of the State deserve the best infrastructure required to boost economic activities and enhance the well-being of the people. The governor noted that while the government will not relent in providing the infrastructure needed to create an enabling environment for business to thrive, it will not tolerate",

            "description": "Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, SERAP, has sent an open letter to President Muhammadu Buhari urging him to use his leadership position to promptly drop the plan by the Federal Government to borrow about N895 billion of unclaimed dividends and funds in dormant accounts using the patently unconstitutional and illegal Finance Act, 2020, and to ensure full respect for Nigerians right to property. The Finance Act, signed into law by Buhari last December, would allow the government to borrow unclaimed dividends and dormant account balances owned by Nigerians in any bank in the country. But SERAP in a letter dated 9 January 2021 and signed by its deputy director Kolawole Oluwadare said: The right to property is a sacred and fundamental right. Borrowing unclaimed dividends and funds in dormant accounts amount to an illegal expropriation, and would hurt poor and vulnerable Nigerians who continue to suffer under reduced public services, and ultimately lead to unsustainable leve",

Insecurity has indeed increased in the country as gunmen, bandits and kidnappers do not just operate on high ways, but have equally summoned courage to attack police stations. A report by Premium Times said that two other officers sustained bullet wounds in the attack. The media identified the slain officers as two male inspectors and a policewoman. When contacted the police spokesperson in the state on Sunday, January 10, 2021, Loveth Odah, confirmed the incident. She said: Yes, three policemen were killed in the attack. We dont know the identity of the attackers yet, and we are calling on the general public to provide information to the police in order to hunt down the perpetrators of this heinous crime.\nThe post Gunmen Storm Police Station, Kill 3 Officers, Steal Arms In Ebonyi appeared first on The Trent.",

Fielding questions on Saturday, January 9, 2021, from Vanguard exclusively, a member of the PDP National Executive Committee, NEC, said though the party fared well in the last general election, particularly the Presidential poll, there are things we didnt get right which we must correct in the next election cycle. Speaking on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak on party affairs, the PDP official stated: We know where we are coming from and the experience is a good guide for the future.
