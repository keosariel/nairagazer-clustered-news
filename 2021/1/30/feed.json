In Nigerias political history, for instance, landmarks would include October 1, 1960, (the day Nigeria gained independence from Britain), January 15, 1966, (when the first of what would become a tradition of military coups occurred), July 6, 1967, (the official start of the 30-month Nigeria-Biafra war) and January 15, 1970, (the official end of the civil war).\u00a0\nTo these dates, I will add January 1, 1914, (the amalgamation of the Southern and Northern Protectorates by the British to create Nigeria), May 27, 1967, (the beginning of state creation in Nigeria), and May 30, 1967, (the official declaration of the secessionist state of Biafra). The latter dates, May 27 and May 30, 1967, are significant in many ways. On May 27, 50 years ago, Yakubu Gowon, who served as head of state of Nigeria from 1",

Falana, while featuring on a Channels Television programme on Friday, January 29, 2021, said the failure of the Federal Government to take action when some Northern Governors repatriated Almajiris back to their home states shows that the issue of security in Nigeria is being politicized. According to him, nobody has the right to issue a quit notice to any Nigerian living in any part of the country. However, the human rights lawyer recalled that the government at the center did not deem it necessary to arrest a Northerner who once asked Igbos living in the North to quit, saying, it is going to be difficult and inequitable to go for Sunday Igboho. He advised that the Oyo State Government should be allowed to handle the security situation in the state within the ambit of the law. He",

Since 2015, former President Jonathan has spent his post Presidential life building consensus and rapprochement within the PDP. He is not paid for this. He is doing it because it is an extension of his omega personality. He reconciled the part",
