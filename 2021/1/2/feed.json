According to him, the bandits had earlier demanded ransom from the farmers before they could harvest their produce. But the farmers refused to give in to their threats and decided to seek for the protection of some vigilante members. Matane explained that after the harvest, one of the drivers, however, decided to move ahead with some farmers, and in the process were attacked by the bandits who killed seven of them. Asked why the information was just coming to the public domain, the Niger state SSG said the government had wanted to be sure of the numbers before making any pronouncement. We were n",

            "description": "Barcelona midfielder Philippe Coutinho has undergone left knee surgery and will be sidelined for around three months, the club revealed on Saturday, January 2, 2021. The 28-year-old Brazilian required the operation to mend a torn meniscus after he limped off the pitch late in Tuesdays home draw with Eibar. That 1-1 stalemate left Ronald Koemans side in sixth in La Liga, 10 points behind leaders Atletico Madrid. Coutinho, who joined Barcelona three years ago from Liverpool but was loaned to Bayern Munich last season, joins Koemans list of long-term absentees which includes Ansu Fati and Gerard Pique, both also sidelined with knee injuries.

The first decentralised cryptocurrency surpassed $30,823.30 at 1313 GMT, according to data compiled by the Bloomberg news agency, having broken $20,000 on December 16. Analyst Timo Emden noted that the appetite for risk, which is reflected in buying of bitcoin, remains unshakeable. More historic highs could follow, the Germany-based analyst added. Just 12 years old, bitcoin has seen a meteoric rise since March, when it stood at $5,000, spurred by online payments giant PayPal saying it would enable account holders to use cryptocurrency. After PayPals announcement in October, analysts at investment banking giant JPMorgan Chase compared the cryptocurrency to gold.
