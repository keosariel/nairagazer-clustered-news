For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. \u2013 2 Corinthians 5:21 Some Christians believe that they have to work at becoming more righteous. And they kick themselves when they do wrong. They dont realize that by doing these things, they are not seeking Gods righteousness, but are trying to establish their own righteousness by their law-keeping and right conduct. Righteousness is not about right conduct. It is a gift from God to us through Jesus. And since it is a gift, we cannot earn it by our law-keeping and right conduct. We can only receive it! How do we receive this gift? We receive it through the cross. God made Jesus who knew no sin to be sin for us that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.

            "description": "See the snake we killed under my neighbours orange tree this morning.I was afraid at first because I know how dangerous this snake is. I had to call some guys to join me. Incidentally, another one was killed less than one hour earlier in the same neighborhood, about 3 houses to where we killed this one, though, bigger than this. The guys I called to assist also happened to be the ones that killed the first snake. They cut its head and tail and said they would go and sell it for around 4k or so. I dont know its name in English, but it is called Oka in Yoruba. If it bites person, that person no go live for two minutes on earth.Aminna Fire fire, food don land. Oya do the needful.",

            "description": "Donald Trump will not be allowed to visit Scotland to play golf during Joe Bidens inauguration, Nicola Sturgeon has said. The US president, who was overwhelmingly defeated in Novembers election, is reportedly considering travelling to his Turnberry golf resort to avoid Mr Biden being sworn into office. But Scotlands first minister stressed it is illegal to travel in or out of the country without a valid reason and said: \"Coming to play golf is not what I would consider to be an essential purpose.\" The White House has repeatedly refused to say what the outgoing president will do when Mr Biden is inaugurated on 20 January, prompting speculation about whether Mr Trump will attend the ceremony.  But Prestwick Airport has been told to expect the arrival of a US military Boeing 757 aircraft previously used by Mr Trump on 19 January.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/trump-biden-inauguration-scotland-sturgeon-lockdown-b1782602.html",
