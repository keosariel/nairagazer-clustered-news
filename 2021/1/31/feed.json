TheCable observed how vehicles and motorcycles struggled to dodge the cattle as they plied the road just beside Cedacrest Hospital in Apo.Two herders seen with the cows also struggled to remain in control of the situation.At intervals, some of the cows pushed their way through the road, bringing vehicles to an abrupt halt. The chaotic scene that ensued was hilarious as much as it was horrific. Some passers-by watched as a particular motorcyclist swerved while trying to dodge a cow whose horn was just inches away from his face.Below are pictures from the scene:    https://www.thecable.ng/photos-cows-block-road-in-abuja-disrupt-vehicular-movement",

For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified. \u2013 1 Corinthians 2:2 The apostle Paul, in his letter to the Corinthian church, said that he determined to know nothing among them except Jesus Christ and Him crucified. In other words, Paul, who wrote two-thirds of the New Testament, had his mind full of Jesus and His finished work. Beloved, God wants your mind full of the cross of Jesus. He wants you cross-conscious. But what does it mean to be cross-conscious? To be cross-conscious is to see Jesus, who loves you so much that He willingly died for you on the cross. To be cross-conscious is to look to Jesus, who offered His own body to be punished, so that your body can be free from all punishment. To be cross-conscious is to fix your eyes on Jesus, who has provided for your deliverance and victory at the cross.",

The Minister also believes that there are missing assessments for Nigeria in the data entries where the country has performed well in previous CPI calculations, which has now affected the overall rating of the country over a period of time. He made this known in a statement issued in Abuja on Sunday, January 31, 2021, while assuring Nigerians that the countrys anti-corruption agenda, which has placed great emphasis on corruption prevention measures and the building of integrity systems, remains on course. In the 2020 index released on Thursday, Nigeria scored 25 out of 100 points, dropping to 149 out of the 180 countries surveyed. The country also went three steps down from the 146 scored in 2019, making it its worst rating on Transparency Internat",

It was a dramatic development in the second impeachment trial for Trump, who has struggled to find lawyers willing to take his case. And now, with legal briefs due next week and a trial set to begin only days later, Trump is clinging to his election fraud charade and suddenly finds himself without legal representation. Butch BowersandDeborah Barbier, who were expected to be two of the lead attorneys, are no longer on the team. A source familiar with the changes said it was a mutual decision for both to leave the legal team. As the lead attorney, Bowers assembled the team. Josh Howard, a North Carolina attorney who was recently added to the team, has also left, according to another source familiar with the changes. Johnny Gasser and Greg Harris, from South Carolina",

Icha Joseph, the state commandant of the agency, stated this during a news conference in Maiduguri on Saturday, January 30, 2021. Joseph said during the lockdown in 2020, the courts were not open at all and as a result, many cases are still pending at the Federal High Court Maiduguri. A total of 16, 904.313kg of illicit drugs were seized last year, the largest seizure ever recorded in a northern state. According to Mr. Joseph, the quantum of drugs mopped up in the state indicates that there was a nexus between hard drugs and insurgency. The recent clash between drug dealers and the military leading to loss of lives in Barka Da Zuwa, a known black spot at the metropolis has now necessitated a synergy among law enforcement outfits.
