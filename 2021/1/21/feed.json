The Pope visited Nigeria that year, specifically, for the Beatification of Father Tansi.

Upon an arrest warrant issued by the court, Maina was later apprehended in the neighbouring country and returned to Nigeria by security agents. In a fresh court document filed by the EFCC, the agency said Maina sneaked out to Niger Republic after jumping court bail was to obtain new travel documents at the Embassy of the United States of America, USA, in Niamey to enable him flee back to the USA with his family where he and his family are equally citizens.

Similarly, the Fulani do not enjoy legal immunity in any part of Nigeria. The Fulani are subject to all laws and regulations and must respect the communities with which they live and interact. What is dangerous and unacceptable is to profile and demonise the Fulani and treat him outside the laws of the land like all other Nigerians.

So, if you know the classic song, Ofe Owere by Oriental Brothers and you still havent gotten to know its history, you will know today, but if you havent ever heard the song, check YouTube.   NOTE:-Premium Ofe Owerri is cooked with stock fish (not the head only, but the head first for its flavour) and dry fish. However, it will be hard not to eat meat in this modern era. So you can throw in some cow leg/head (preferably). -Soak your dry fish in hot water and debone it.-It wasnt intended to be refrigerated. That is why it is considered expensive. You cook it and eat it once.-It has two leaves in it, pumpkin (ugu) and okazi. Okazi is the leaf Ibibios/Efiks call afang. Feel free to add uziza for its flavour.-Boil and pound your cocoyam. PLEASE DONT BOIL WITH SALT. If you dont have a mortar, you can also use a blender or food processor.-Slice your leaves. They should be thin.",

He is asking the Ibarapa sons and daughters, in the mode of that sentry of misery, Femi Adesina, that they give up their freedom and liberty, their lives and land.\nThe speech which with enthusiasm, excoriated the Yorb victims of Fulani murders, kidnappings, raping and arson, smacks of rant of a favoured slave. For Makinde to come out with this kind of threat against his own people, shows that he is a collaborator with the enemies of Yorb Nation. He is an enabler of the fulani aggressors on Yorb land. Makinde, with that speech, shows that he is happy with the murdering of innocent Yorb sons and daughters. He is ready to fight on the side of Fulani herdsmen against the Yorb people who voted for him to protect",
