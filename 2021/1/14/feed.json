Gen. Ronald Lee identified the fatality as Christopher Chukwuma, a member of the West African drug syndicate who lures Filipinos to become drug mules for them.The operation was conducted in an inn along Escarpment Road in Barangay Bagong Ilog at 5:30 p.m. on Monday.The operation led to an armed encounter that resulted in the death of Chukwuma.The report said Chukwuma, upon sensing that he was dealing with police officers, grabbed the firearm of the poseur buyer.This prompted arresting police officers to shoot the suspect as an act of self-defense.Chukwuma yielded two pieces of transparent plastic shabu weighing more or less two kilograms and boodle money.He was able to escape from an earlier buy-bust operation in Tarlac last Dec. 31, 202",

The Governor made the comment while reacting to a quit notice delivered to the Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Mathew Kukah. Kukah, on Christmas Day, had delivered a message titled, A Nation in Search of Vindication, where he predicted the country was heading for darkness under the Muhammadu Buhari administration. But a group, the Muslim Solidarity Forum, faulted the Bishops comments and asked him to tender an unreserved apology or leave Sokoto state. The Presidency has condemned the Muslim groups notice for Kukah to leave Sokoto state. According to a statement released by Spokesman Terver Akase, Governor Ortom found the statement as a contradiction of the countrys constitution which states that Nigerians have the right to live freely in any part of the country.
