I think it is best for my sanity just to avoid that overall question. I can take bits and pieces of Nigerias present predicament but I think for ones sense of balance, one must forget the existence of the Buhari administration.READ ALSO: Lagos orders public, private schools to resume Jan 18The playwright said for years Niger",

Mohammed warned these foreign organisations to desist from threatening Nigerian troops and putting national security in jeopardy. The minister, who spoke with journalists in Lagos on the state of the nation, highlighted governments efforts on security, anti-COVID battle, the economy, agriculture, the oil sector, infrastructure and power, and border drill.

Based on my tenancy agreement,I renewed my rent early than expected because I had a lot of activities lined up for the year that will require money. Besides, I dont want landlord to remind me that my rent has expired.In previous years, I renewed my rent on the second week of the beginning of the month so that I dont send a signal of abundance on my side. Sometimes, I pay in arrears even when the money is there.I was surprised that after making the payment, I got a notification of increment of rent effective from January, 2022.My family has been very peaceful tenant since we parked in. I  have thought through the notice to find the best way to approach him to withdraw the increment without him giving me an option to park out if I am not comfortable.Please advise me on the best approach to use in this situation.",
