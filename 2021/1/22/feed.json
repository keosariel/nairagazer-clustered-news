It should be noted that achieving Tawheed or true belief in the Oneness of Allaah can only be done by testifying truly that there is no god but Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah. Achieving this is of two degrees, one that is obligatory and one that is mustahabb. The obligatory degree is achieved by means of three things:1-Giving up shirk (association of others with Allaah) in all its forms, major, minor and concealed.2-Giving up bidah (innovation) in all its forms.3-Giving up sin in all its forms.The mustahabb degree is that in which people may vary greatly, and it means not having anything in the heart of attachment to anything or anyo",

In his youth, this reptile lover spent 72 hours in an enclosure with 72 venomous snakes for company.
