Modesty is an adornment for a believer and fortification of Iman. It is the platform from which many other noble traits are developed. If this trait is nurtured, it develops and beautifies the character of the person.When a person becomes accustomed to sin, it is a sign that modesty and shame have left that person.Abu Hurayrah (R) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) said, Iman has more than 70 branches; the most sublime of all is the Kalimah La Ilaha Illallah  and the lowest branch of Iman is to remove a harmful object from the path. And Haya (modesty and shame) is an integral branch of Iman. (Sahih Muslim)Abu Masood (R) narrates that Nabi (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) said, One of the advices that the people learnt fr",

With his fellow Democrats narrowly controlling both houses of Congress, Biden has a shot at passing what would be the United States third massive pandemic aid package. Dubbed the American Rescue Plan, the proposal released on Thursday, January 14, 2021, includes a host of measures aimed at revitalizing the worlds largest economy. Biden aims to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, help struggling state and local governments, safely reopen schools, roll out a massive Covid-19 vaccination campaign and raise the size of stimulus checks Congress approved last month. The return on these investment in jobs, racial equity will prevent long-term economic damage, and the benefits will far surpass the cost, Biden said during a speech in Wilmington, Delaware.

This is disappointing and unacceptable and, if not handled properly, has the potential of leading to a major religious conflagration and crisis. I say this because Kukah is deeply loved by millions from all over the country and the Christian community rever and adore him. The Muslim Solidarity Forum are seeking to undermine the great work that the Sultan of Sokoto has achieved in creating peace in the Caliphate between Christians and Muslims over the last few years.

She hadnt planned to have five children; she wanted a baby girl so badly and after four boys her baby girl finally came. What a joy! Many years have passed and her children are all grown up.

They cook all kinds of food except when she wants to cook the soup herself! Not many mums can boast of their children like she did, when in most homes today children are spoiled and wouldnt lift a finger, boys and girls alike.She told me she runs classes on baking and cooking and in the course of working with young girls she discovered most of them have no idea what to do around the kitchen. She said with so much pain that we mothers have become so busy we have no time to train our children especially our girls. Unlike in our own day",
