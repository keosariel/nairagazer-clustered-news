This is certainly the handiwork of mischief makers who are threatened by the Governors rising political profile.We are amused that political detractors will stop at nothing to see how they can distract Governor Wikes visionary leadership.For the umpteenth time, we wish to restate that Governor Wike is presently preoccupied with his mission  to make Rivers State a  better place and Destination of Choice. All the puerile antics of political jobbers aimed at heating up the polity will surely fail.Members of the public are therefore advised to discountenance the misinformation that is currently circulating in Abuja.Paulinus Nsirim Commissioner for Information and Communications January 25, 20",

            "description": "The Nigeria Governors Forum, NGF, has said that there was no eviction order to herdsmen in Ondo State or any part of the South West region. It said the speech of Ondo Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, was misconstrued in the media and was only directed at government reserve including registration. Kayode Fayemi, the chairman of NGF and Governor of Ekiti State, spoke in Akure at a meeting with the national leadership of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria, MACBAN. Fayemi noted that the statement generated a lot of hoopla which led to what he described as unfortunate development in Oyo State. He said Akeredolu didnt talk about herdsmen vacating the state but about registration of herdsmen who want to operate within the reserves. The Ekiti Governor said they are after criminals and not fulani herdsmen.

The meeting was attended by our brother governors from Kebbi and Jigawa States; security chiefs, SW zone led by the AIG Zone 11 and leaders from the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria.Collectively, we resolved to ban open grazing in all parts of the south west. In Oyo State, we already have a law against open grazing which will continue to be implemented by our security agencies. I restated that we will not permit criminality as a response to criminal actions. Instead we will continue to support our security agencies to do their duties. Also, we will work with our people to face our common enemies - the criminals; kidnappers, armed robbers and bandits.https://twitter.com/seyiamakinde/status/1353768016492851203",

Citizens are kidnapped every day from their homes but sadly, some of these tragedies escape outrage and alarm. There is a false sense of security in the federal capital territory (FCT)  the flawed assumption of safety  which has enabled the atrocities of bandits in the nations capital to persist without hysteria.\nSecurity agencies  all with headquarters in Abuja  get away with non-performance as regards the FCT largely because of this false sense of security by residents.
