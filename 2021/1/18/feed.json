He had a way of making everyone feel special. Incredible soul who could quote Shakespeare within an extempore speech, highly observant, a leader of leaders. Ogun, nay Nigeria, lost an inspirational leader. It hits you when you look around, especially in Ogun, to try to find leaders that can be held up as role models in the political class. You are bound to feel some sadness, not because immortality has been promised anyone, old or young, but because you get a sense of irreplaceability that leaders like Sen Jubril Martins-Kuye are indeed hard to find in the present time. May his soul rest in peace. May his family and loved ones be comforted. For everything, there is a season. Fare thee well, JMK.https://www.facebook.com/715462527/posts/10158848222692528/?d=n",

            "description": "Adamu Adamu, the minister of education, on Monday, January 18, 2021, clarified that the Federal Government had reservations about the resumption of schools on January 18. According to him, while the states wanted to go ahead with the schools resumption, the Federal Government was against it but had to reach a compromise since it does not control all the schools We sat down, looked at the figures and we took the decision that schools should not open. Unfortunately, we have to state this because it is supposed to be a collective decision, but you must understand that the schools we are talking about, the Federal Government has only about 100 out of thousands of schools. The schools are under the jurisdiction of states and just as the PTF was unanimous in saying that schools should not open, states were unanimous that schools should open. So, we have to compromise and as PTF we shall monitor what is happening on a daily basis. There could be some review again, Adamu stated. Source: Vangua",

A similar affair looks likely unless the home side strike early: the Magpies are adept when asked to sit in but, as they showed at Sheffield United, a more proactive approach appears to be beyond them.

I used to be the Ambassador to South Africa/Lesotho and Swaziland; the populations of Swaziland, Lesotho, and Botswana are still not up to 15 million.
