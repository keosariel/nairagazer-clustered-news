My focus is that the country called Nigeria is dying. I do not know what sort of security briefing President Muhammadu Buhari, regularly or periodically, receives from his obviously reticent and incompetent security team. I doubt it includes the fact that Nigeria is speeding towards a monumental collapse, unless a miracle, or something drastic is done to stop this supersonic drift towards perdition. It might even be that the President does not receive any or proper security details, either because he does not want to hear or worse still, he assumes all is well. Which- ever way one contemplates these last two scenarios, it is a calamity indeed.Believe me, Im not writing as a wailing wailer, or as a Prophet of doom.

He pulled up trees last season to get them in the Champions League, and they are still in the competition this season.They have had a bad run. Theyve brought in a lot of players and Lampard is working with the best group of players hes worked with, but most of them play in the same position.For me, they had to give him a chance.Did Chelsea think they were going to buy a 21-year-old kid from Germany in Kai Havertz, another forward from Germany in Timo Werner, Hakim Ziyech and a 36-year-old defender in Thiago Silva and just win the league?Did they really think they were going to finish above the likes of Liverpool, Man City and Man Utd just like that?In this league at the moment, especially with no fans, its difficult.",

Kayode Fayemi, the chairman of NGF and Governor of Ekiti State, spoke in Akure at a meeting with the national leadership of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria, MACBAN. Fayemi noted that the statement generated a lot of hoopla which led to what he described as unfortunate development in Oyo State.
