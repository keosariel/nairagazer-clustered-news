            "description": "When Christians are stingy they usually never realize it. You can give and still be stingy. There are some people who give, but with a grudging heart. They think Aww, do I really have too? There are some people who offer things, but in their mind they hope the other person says no.We must not be lovers of self and lovers of money. We must think about others just like Christ thought about us. Give with a cheerful heart not expecting anything in return. Be generous and love others just like Christ loves you. Stinginess is not part of the Christian life.People are worth more than material things you must never forget that. Where are you storing up your treasures? Would you rather buy stuff or help the poor? Why not readjust your giving today and be a blessing to others.It isso hard for rich people to enter into Heaven.What does the Bible say?1. Proverbs 28:22-24The stingy person hastens after richesand does not know that poverty will overtake him.The one who reproves another will in the e",

As expected, the evil devil is aware of this, and he is extremely jealous. The devil hates you sorely, and he is already eager to do what he knows how to do best: \"steal, kill and destroy\" (John 10:10).In history, and all through the Bible, there are several incidents where the devil successfully ruined glorious men and turned them into ashes. He utilized several mediums, particularly via members of the opposite gender, usually through illicit sexual encounters. One glaring case study, as far as such a discourse as this is concerned, is that of Samson. As men, we should learn from Samsons brief life, so we wont fall into the same pit he fell into.First, before Samson was born, he was ordained by God to become a great and mighty deliverer",

These promises were made on everything from climate change to immigration to foreign policy, and many are reflected in Klains Saturday memo, which was first reported by the New York Times.\"Dur",

            "description": "Men like Kuye are rare. Very intelligent, highly read, easy to talk to, firm at the negotiating table, deep connect across the spectrum of the social class. He had a way of making everyone feel special. Incredible soul who could quote Shakespeare within an extempore speech, highly observant, a leader of leaders. Ogun, nay Nigeria, lost an inspirational leader. It hits you when you look around, especially in Ogun, to try to find leaders that can be held up as role models in the political class. You are bound to feel some sadness, not because immortality has been promised anyone, old or young, but because you get a sense of irreplaceability that leaders like Sen Jubril Martins-Kuye are indeed hard to find in the present time. May his soul rest in peace. May his family and loved ones be comforted. For everything, there is a season. Fare thee well, JMK.https://www.facebook.com/715462527/posts/10158848222692528/?d=n",
