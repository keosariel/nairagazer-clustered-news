But just as it was about to commence, the weather changed; a bleak rain cloud overshadowed the place.I called out to a so-called pastor nearby: Come, I said, Let us shift this rain.  Immediately, a cloud came over him. I could see fear written all over his face. But I did not allow him to equivocate. I grabbed his hands and decreed that the rain must go away from the location for the wedding in Jesus name.Just as soon as I finished, the cloud broke and moved away. I could not help but laugh at the pastor.  You were so scared, I berated him.  But dont you see, the cloud has moved.It rained elsewhere on that day, but no drop of rain came near the location of the wedding.https://opinion.premiumtimesng.com/2021/01/03/the-believers-authority-by-femi-aribisala/",

Sayo Akintola, the spokesman of the agency, who made this known during an interview with journalists on Sunday, January 3, 2021, said local trials for the vaccine were unnecessary since the vaccine was already certified by the World Health Organisation. The truth is that once a vaccine is approved by the WHO, it is assumed that it has passed through some preliminary stages of the trial. It is a known fact that for the WHO to sanction a vaccine, it must have gone through a series of trials here and there, he said. He, however, explained that a sample of the vaccine will be taken to the lab for its safety and efficacy to be ascertained before inoculation.

Mustapha Inuwa, the secretary to the Katsina State Government, who stated this in an interview with Vanguard on Sunday, January 3, 2021, instead kicked against the idea of payment of ransom which he said if encouraged will fuel criminality instead of tackling the menace. According to him, We can understand it is a very delicate situation because you cannot tell somebody whose loved one is kidnapped not to pay the ransom because the major fear is they will be killed.
