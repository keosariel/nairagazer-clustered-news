Famous for conceding a bitterly-contested election in 2014, Jonathan said the purpose of leadership was to bring people together, not divide them. I have repeatedly said nobodys political ambition is worth the blood of any citizen, in any part of the world, he said. Absolutely nobody. He added: Again, I reiterate that it is better to lose power at the cost of gaining peace, than to gain power at the price of losing the peace. As a leader, one must not just look unto ones own interest, but the interest and the good of society. It is never too late to reject the venom and inject the serum of peace.
