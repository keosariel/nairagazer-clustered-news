The Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission, ICPC, claimed the funds were kept in accounts in two new generation banks by Yari, using his two companies  Kayatawa Nigeria Limited and B.T. Oil and Gas Nigeria Limited. Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu, in a judgment on Tuesday, January 26, 2021, held that Yari could not prove how he got funds while or before serving as governor of Zamfara State between May 29, 2011, and May 29, 2019. Justice Ojukwu queried how one of companies bank accounts grew from zero to $301,319 at the end of his tenure. The judge, who said Yari cannot claim the funds are his without providing evidence, rejected his claim that the action of the ICPC was political witch-hunt.
