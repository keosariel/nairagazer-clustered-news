With the increase in online loaning apps, falling into the trap of taking loans is now very easy and at the comfort of your home without even visiting any office or filling any form.When you incur debts, it is like you are stealing from your future especially when they are incurred on consumable expenses. Getting out of debt is one of the best feelings on earth, in fact, that breath of relieve is worth more than gold.The stress of taking calls from your creditors and explaining why you havent paid your debts is not healthy. Like waking up to emails and reminders about loan repayments. I have seen people who died while thinking about the huge debts they incurred, some even commit suicide. Some people have to run away from home so that their creditors wont find them. I am sure this is not the type of life you want to live in the year",

The Good News is that through Jesus Christ, any human (irrespective of how dirty they have been living), can become a bonafide child of the Almighty God, and can maintain a pleasurable relationship with YAHWEH, which empowers them to have dominion over creation.

It is addictive. Its easy to say \"take a little\", but many who have become addicted to alcohol today didnt start by taking much. And once one becomes addicted to it, its hard to come out of it. Thats how many found themselves trapped today. So dont start what you cant finish.Isaiah 5:22 (KJV)  Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink:3. It impairs peoples judgment.Isaiah 28:7 (KJV)  But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment.Proverbs 31:4-5",
